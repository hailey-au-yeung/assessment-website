            <div class="heads">About this site</div>
            <p>This website aims to be a hub of activity for crochet; a 'one-stop shop' for the crochet community.</p> 
            <p>It has a homepage (<a href="index.html">the index</a>), a homepage for the <a href="patterns.html">crochet patterns</a>, which hosts 3 pages: a guide to <a href="howto.html">how to</a> read a pattern, a <a href="whale.html">crochet whale pattern</a> and a <a href="bee.html">crochet bee pattern</a>. There are then separate pages for exploring the <a href="community.html">community</a>, the <a href="products.html">products</a> and the <a href="features.html">features</a>.</p>
            <p>These pages cover the main aspects around crochet and can act as a starting point for crocheters trying to find something, whether it be patterns, books, products or a community. </p>
            <hr>
            <div class="fheads">Functions supporting the aim</div>
            <p>The website is predominantly coded in HTML apart from one Javascript element in the image carousel and formatted using CSS. The index has lots of images and is nicely spaced to spark interest. The buttons create a clear way to access the different pages. The pattern homepage uses the same format to create continuity and have the same advantages of the format. The tables in the 3 pattern pages make it easier the pages easier to read and understand the information. The community page has lines separating the different questions, making it easier to read. It also has a map to make it easier for the user to find their local group and see a visual representation of the locations. The product page is nicely spaced and has one line per aspect: tools, yarn and books. This makes it easier to read and interpret. It also makes shopping easier as similar items are placed together. The feature page is an image carousel, a nice addition that gives the user some interaction with the site. It also provides a community aspect to crocheting as they can see other people's current activities.</p>

            <div class="fheads">How the website guides the user</div>
            <p>Both the image and the text in the header are links to the index to create easier access to the homepage. The navigation bar is a darker colour to draw attention to the hyperlinks. As stated, the buttons on the index and pattern pages show clear ways to access the the different pages. The footer at the bottom of the page gives the user a brief overview of the subjects in the site and guides them to go to whichever page sparks their interest. </p>
            <hr>
            <div class="fheads">Look of the website</div>
            <p>My website has a pink colour scheme and uses two fonts; one for the headers and one for the body text. It was formatted using one external well-commented CSS document to ensure a consistent look. A table is included in the <a href="howto.html">how to</a> page, the <a href="whale.html">whale</a> pattern and the <a href="bee.html">bee</a> pattern. Lists are also incorporated in the website in the navigation bar, the footer, the community page, the whale pattern and many more. The boxes in the index are flex boxes, as well as the header, the navigation bar and the footer. </p>
